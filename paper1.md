### Description:


This paper mainly discussed the ways to reproducing  `the Ensemble Average Polar Solvation Energy`
(<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Delta G^{Sol}_{pol}">) from `a Single Structure`, which can be 
a `Energy Minimized Structure` in `Explicit Water`, `Implicit Solvent` and in `Vacuum` environments. Or it can be a `Crystal` structure.
