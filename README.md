# Poisson Boltzmann Equation Project
This project kinda like a build-up procedure when I use java to realize the Poisson Boltzmann Equation solving algorithm, which is the main work i did in my mathatical phd student life.
It basically includes two main part: one is the solving procedure part, and another one is all those single problems I encountered during the solving procedure.
Since this is just the start, I will try to add up more contents then polish my readme file.
That's it, hope you enjoy it.
