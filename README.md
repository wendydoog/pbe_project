# Poisson Boltzmann Equation Project

`Description`: This project is kinda like a build-up procedure when I do my research of building new formulations and algorithms for solving Poisson-Boltzmann Equation, which is widely used for the study in biological and chemical systems at molecular level, etc. This the main work I am doing in my mathematical Ph.D. student journey.

It includes `main algorithm part`, `knowledge of related-field part` and `realization part`, in which the description of some packages or libraries used will be included. I try to realize the main algorithm by using `Fortran`, `Java` and `python` seperately. 

Since this is just a start, I will try to add up more contents then polish my readme file.

That's it, hope you enjoy it.
