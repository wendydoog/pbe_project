# Poisson Boltzmann Equation Project
This project is kinda like a build-up procedure when I use java to realize the Poisson Boltzmann Equation solving algorithm, which is the main work i did in my mathematical Ph.D. student life.

It basically includes two main parts: one is the solving procedure part, and another one is all those single problems I encountered during the solving procedure.

Since this is just a start, I will try to add up more contents then polish my readme file.

That's it, hope you enjoy it.
